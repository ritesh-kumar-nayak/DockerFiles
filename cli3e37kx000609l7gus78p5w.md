# Project Overview

In this project, we'll be hosting a web application which is a social site developed by developers, and the application is based on **Java.**

The user can access the application using an **IP** address from his/her browser(as we are setting up the project locally for now).

The **Load Balancer** will provide this IP as shown below in the image.

We'll be using **Nginx** as the reverse proxy to create the Load balancing experience. As soon as the request comes from the users, **Nginx** will route the request to Apache Tomcat Service.

**Apache Tomcat** is a Java Web Application service. When the application is written in **Java**, it will be hosted on Apache Tomcat.

**RabbitMQ** is connected to **Tomcat** which is a **Message Broker** or **Queueing Agent.** To connect 2 applications, you can stream the data from this.

**Memcached** is a **Database cashing** service, it will be connected to the **MySQL** server. When the user logs in for the first time, it will be stored in MySQL DB and cached in Memcached so, the next time when the same user sends a request, it will be retrieved from the Memcached service.

# Setting up the VMs

Previously we have been using AWS EC2 instances in all our projects. However, here I have tried a new approach. In this project, we'll be firing up the VMs in our Local system for each service listed above.

Here we'll be using **Oracle Virtual Box** to lunch VMs with **Vagrant** to automate the lunch of these VMs.

## Writing a Vagrant File

A vagrant file is nothing but a piece of configuration that will **automate** the **lunch** of multiple VMs locally through Oracle Virtual Box which is written in Ruby.

**NB:** Before writing and proceeding with VM setup we have to install the **Hostmanager plugin** by `$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager` command.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684994942397/6c82dcb4-e010-48ed-b3b6-17426bdda5c6.png align="center")

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.hostmanager.enabled = true 
  config.hostmanager.manage_host = true
  
### Nginx VM ###
  config.vm.define "web01" do |web01|
    web01.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
    web01.vm.hostname = "web01"
	web01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.11"
  end
  
### tomcat vm ###
   config.vm.define "app01" do |app01|
    app01.vm.box = "geerlingguy/centos7"
    app01.vm.hostname = "app01"
    app01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.12"
	app01.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "1024"
	 end
   end
   
### RabbitMQ vm  ####
  config.vm.define "rmq01" do |rmq01|
    rmq01.vm.box = "geerlingguy/centos7"
	rmq01.vm.hostname = "rmq01"
    rmq01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.16"
  end
  
### Memcache vm  #### 
  config.vm.define "mc01" do |mc01|
    mc01.vm.box = "geerlingguy/centos7"
	mc01.vm.hostname = "mc01"
    mc01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.14"
  end
  
### DB vm  ####
  config.vm.define "db01" do |db01|
    db01.vm.box = "geerlingguy/centos7"
	db01.vm.hostname = "db01"
    db01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.15"
  end
end
```

In the above code, we have configured **5 VMs** for each service such as Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcache, and MySQL DB respectively.

## Code Explanation

1. The `Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|` block initializes the Vagrant configuration.
    
2. `config.hostmanager.enabled = true` enables the Vagrant Hostmanager plugin, which manages the hosts file on the host machine.
    
3. `config.hostmanager.manage_host = true` allows Vagrant to manage the host entries for the VMs.
    
4. The `web01` VM definition starts with `config.vm.define "web01" do |web01|`. This VM is using the "ubuntu/bionic64" box, has the hostname "web01," and is assigned the IP address "192.168.56.11" on a private network.
    
5. The `app01` VM definition starts with `config.vm.define "app01" do |app01|`. This VM is using the "geerlingguy/centos7" box, has the hostname "app01," and is assigned the IP address "192.168.56.12" on a private network. It also sets the memory allocation for the VM to 1024 MB using the VirtualBox provider.
    
6. The `rmq01` VM definition starts with `config.vm.define "rmq01" do |rmq01|`. This VM is using the "geerlingguy/centos7" box, has the hostname "rmq01," and is assigned the IP address "192.168.56.16" on a private network.
    
7. The `mc01` VM definition starts with `config.vm.define "mc01" do |mc01|`. This VM is using the "geerlingguy/centos7" box, has the hostname "mc01," and is assigned the IP address "192.168.56.14" on a private network.
    
8. The `db01` VM definition starts with `config.vm.define "db01" do |db01|`. This VM is using the "geerlingguy/centos7" box, has the hostname "db01," and is assigned the IP address "192.168.56.15" on a private network.
    

# VMs up & Running(`vagrant up` )

Now after preparing the Vagrant file, we'll start the VMs using `vagrant up` command in the same directory where the Vagrant file is present.

Currently, on my Virtual Box, there are no VMs available:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684996513253/1c3f08bd-8e42-44da-a01e-e7d591edc2b3.png align="center")

Once we do `vagrant up` , it will start firing up VMs as below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684998515181/03e6d8f5-ba2a-4051-9fb7-44867ef17dea.png align="center")

Once the entire setup is completed, we can see all the VMs listed in VBox

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684998575444/0babc7c6-94f0-44a2-ae19-60ca706c4cb0.png align="center")

## Validating the Connection among Servers

It is necessary to validate these servers because the **Nginx** server == will connect to ==&gt; **Tomcat**.

**Tomcat** == to ==&gt; Db and all other services accordingly.

We can validate by doing SSH to each server and making a simple **ping** to each service.

**NB: Until now these are just empty servers(VMs), going forward we will set up all the services in their respective VMs.**

### 1) web01(For Nginx service)

`vagrant ssh web01` will allow us to ssh into the **Nginx** VM

`$ cat /etc/hosts` will show the hosts below where all the services are listed that it will interact with:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684999707025/d6fdca6e-05f9-49f5-9912-20cc379d9c55.png align="center")

### 2) app01(For Tomcat service)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685001815604/fa61e2a2-896e-488e-bc58-186eeca64ddf.png align="center")

# Setting up Services

## 1) Setup MySQL(Database SVC)

* **Updating the Server:**
    
    `vagrant ssh db01` will allow us to ssh into the DB server.
    
    `sudo -i` get the root privilege
    
    `yum update -y` to update the server
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685004064240/6abdcb16-d52d-4bbd-b307-7c13ba7d2e84.png align="center")

* **Setting up the password for DB:**
    
    `vi /etc/profile` : This file typically contains system-wide environment variables and startup configurations for all users.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685004540013/747579f3-d566-4b95-9503-db95ebfb6b3f.png align="center")
    
    `source /etc/profile` : using this command you persist the password as an environment variable.
    
* **Installing EPL repository:**
    
    `yum install epel-release -y` : The term "epl-release" typically refers to the "Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release." EPEL is a repository project that provides additional software packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and other compatible Linux distributions.
    
* **Installing Maria DB and Git:**
    
    `yum install git mariadb-server -y` : This will install maria db server and git as well.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685005714712/ecc3652f-783f-4d3e-8ba5-0afb18bf1683.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685005763199/4469fb0c-c2e0-42e8-ad82-ebf11706ccab.png align="center")
    
    * **Starting up and enabling maria DB:**
        
        `systemctl start mariadb` : this command will start the DB
        
        `systemctl enable mariadb` : it will enable the db service to up and run automatically when system reboots.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685008564383/763a65fe-3493-4677-893d-de7518d14002.png align="center")
        
        `systemctl status mariadb` : this will check the status of the DB
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685008635436/72b699f7-14ae-4026-b7bd-19ced18b6e30.png align="center")
        
* **Setting up Root Password for Maria DB:**
    
    `mysql_secure_installation` : is a shell script that enables you to improve the security of your MySQL installation.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685010220655/a6d626e5-d75f-441f-b714-c00a4af6b419.png align="center")
    

**Logging in to SQL DB:**

`mysql -u root -p` : using this command followed by the password we can login to the DB.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685010602810/57fecd85-4f2b-42e6-8cd2-c2f9ec5c4406.png align="center")

### Cloning the Project Source code

We'll be cloning the VProfile project code to the DB server to run the SQL queries written in the project to make the DB ready to work with other services. To do so we have to clone the project to the DB server by:

`git clone -b local-setup` [`https://github.com/rkn1999/vprofile-project.git`](https://github.com/rkn1999/vprofile-project.git) : this will clone the entire project to the server.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685013206757/f435021b-6021-4e6f-8a30-fbd798e32de9.png align="center")

Once we cloned the project, we can see that we have a file named `db_backup.sql` which will help us to initialize the database.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685013812018/09e56614-7562-4b1e-9fa7-5fbb9c3d1e0a.png align="center")

Before that we have to create a database.

### Creating a database in DB server

`mysql -u root -p"$DATABASE_PASS" -e "create database accounts"` : this will create a database named `accounts`**.**

`mysql -u root -p"$DATABASE_PASS" -e "grant all privileges on accounts.* To 'admin'@'app01' identified by 'admin123' "` : this will add a user in MySQL named `admin`**.** admin user from the database can be accessed from **app01** server and it'll have full privileges on **accounts** database.

### Running the db\_backup.sql

`mysql -u root -p"$DATABASE_PASS" accounts < src/main/resources/db_backup.sql`

The above command will get into **accounts** database and run the `db_backup.sql`

`mysql -u root -p"$DATABASE_PASS" -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES"`

The above command executes a SQL statement that reloads the grant tables in the MySQL server, making any changes to user accounts or privileges effective immediately.

### Database setup completed

Now, after flushing the `PRIVILEGES` a database named accounts has been created in the MySQL

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685015398371/22fd80e6-e196-4a49-9055-0102459d67c5.png align="center")

This is all done by the **db\_backup.sql** query.

## 2) Setup Memcache(DB Caching SVC)

`vagrant ssh mc01` will allow us to ssh into the Memcache server.

`sudo -i` get the root privilege

`yum update -y` to update the server

`yum install Memcached -y` : this will install the memcache service

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685020278423/5b1e62e8-a53b-4243-a875-ea4b06e30f2e.png align="center")

`systemctl enable memcached` : this will enable the memcache service so that, it will automatically up and run on system reboot.

`systemctl start memcached` : it will start the memcache service

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685020351484/53ff1ae8-fd37-47ec-af24-34a9e6511a3b.png align="center")

`memcached -p 11211 -u 11111 -u memcached -d` : This is the command to start the Memcached service.

* `-p 11211`: This option specifies the port on which Memcached will listen. In this case, it is set to port 11211.
    
* `-u 11111`: This option sets the user ID under which Memcached will run. In this case, it is set to user ID 11111.
    
* `-u memcached`: This option specifies an additional user ID. It seems like you have specified the `-u` option twice, once with a numeric user ID (11111) and once with a username (`memcached`).
    
* `-d`: This option tells Memcached to run in the background as a daemon.
    

We can also validate whether it's listening to the above said port by `ss -tunlp | grep 11211`:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685020756806/6fd9e9f0-5446-4062-8267-721b61bbfb6a.png align="center")

**Memcache setup is completed !**

## 3) Setup RabbitMQ(Broker/Queue SVC)

`vagrant ssh rmq01` will allow us to ssh into the RabbitMQ server.

`sudo -i` get the root privilege

`yum update -y` to update the server

`yum install Memcached -y` : this will install the memcache service

### Installing dependencies for RabbitMQ

`yum install wget -y`

`cd /tmp/` : move to tmp directory

`wget` [`http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions-2.0-1.noarch.rpm`](http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions-2.0-1.noarch.rpm) : download this RPM

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685022131391/a99883da-edc2-4006-a0f3-3ec6b5a04aee.png align="center")

`sudo rpm -Uvh erlang-solutions-2.0-1.noarch.rpm` : installing the downloaded RPM

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685022109741/6044c07d-9d43-45b9-afe3-d0a66304a06b.png align="center")

`sudo yum -y install erlang socat` : installing erlang and after completing this the dependencies installation has been completed.

### Installing RabbitMQ Server

`curl -s` [`https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh`](https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh) `| sudo bash` : Downloading RabbitMQ with a bash script which will setup the RabbitMQ repository.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685022459527/9ee33cc4-787e-4be1-99f8-6fb58a165e6e.png align="center")

`sudo yum install rabbitmq-server -y` : Now this will install the RabbitMQ server

### Starting the Service

`systemctl start rabbitmq-server` : this will start the service

`systemctl enable rabbitmq-server` : this will enable the server

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685022765586/da3b55d4-153e-491e-bc7f-150fdc2631fc.png align="center")

### Config Changed in RabbitMQ

`sudo sh -c 'echo "[{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}]." > /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config'` : this will pass the output of loobback\_users into rabbitmq.config file.

`sudo rabbitmqctl add_user test test` : it will add a user test with password test

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685023798864/a4153f47-b9db-4fd5-bcac-4687e45d58e1.png align="center")

`sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags test administrator` : this will give administrator prevelege to the user test.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685023980447/8504b78f-619b-4af5-9fc4-34e7d28b8699.png align="center")

### Restarting RabbitMQ server

`systemctl restart rabbitmq-server` : this will restart the server and persist the config changes.

## 4) Tomcat Setup(Application SVC)

Tomcat is the service where our application will be hosted.

`vagrant ssh app01` will allow us to ssh into the Tomcat VM where it will be installed.

`sudo -i` get the root privilege

`yum update -y` to update the server

### Tomcat Dependancies

`yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y` : Tomcat requires open JDK 1.8.0 to be installed.

`yum install git maven wget -y` : we also need git, maven and wget to be installed as part of dependencies for our project.

### Tomcat Installation

`cd /tmp/` : move to tmp directory

**Download Tomcat package :**

`wget` [`https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.37/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.37.tar.gz`](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.37/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.37.tar.gz)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685025404754/0517561a-f02e-452c-b042-b58b6607c75f.png align="center")

**Extracting the package:**

`tar xzvf apache-tomcat-8.5.37.tar.gz`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685025500605/112bf662-5cbe-47e8-84ff-fa979e582f30.png align="center")

After extracting we can see the tomcat directory:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685025571449/76b8709e-97a1-46c8-a002-c561ca786b73.png align="center")

### Adding Tomcat user

`useradd --home-dir /usr/local/tomcat8 --shell /sbin/nologin tomcat`

### Copying data to Tomcat home directory

`cp -r /tmp/apache-tomcat-8.5.37/* /usr/local/tomcat8/`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685026135300/db777683-acbd-4169-865b-cfca2daecdbc.png align="center")

### Making Tomcat user the owner of tomcat home dir

`chown -R tomcat.tomcat /usr/local/tomcat8`

### Setting up Systemd for Tomcat

By setting up the systemd we can start and stop the Tomcat Service just by the command `start tomcat` and `stop tomcat` and to do so, we have to create a file as tomcat.service at the below given path with **vi:**

`vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service` : it will create a file and the below snippet will be the content of the file to support the Tomcat service.

```bash
[Unit] Description=Tomcat After=network.target [Service] User=tomcat WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/tomcat8 Environment=JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat8 Environment=CATALINE_BASE=/usr/local/tomcat8 ExecStart=/usr/local/tomcat8/bin/catalina.sh run ExecStop=/usr/local/tomcat8/bin/shutdown.sh SyslogIdentifier=tomcat-%i [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`systemctl daemon-reload`: Once you make changes to the Tomcat service file we have to reload it.

### Starting and Enabling Tomcat Service

`systemctl enable tomcat`

`systemctl start tomcat`

`systemctl status tomcat`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685027244509/3ab35ebf-9423-4ebe-ba73-c84a9b6fb1f8.png align="center")

With this, service setup is DONE !!!

# Code Build & Deploy Artifacts

### Cloning the Source Code

`git clone -b local-setup` [`https://github.com/rkn1999/vprofile-project.git`](https://github.com/rkn1999/vprofile-project.git) : this will clone the project to **/tmp** directory and from here we'll be build the project and generate the artifact.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1685027953811/bc0df55c-40b2-487b-bf83-f7b0d780b288.png align="center")

### Updating Configuration File

However, before generating the artifact, we have to update the configuration file which will help to connect to all the backend services.

The configuration file is present in `src/main/resources/application.properties` which has the content as below:

```bash
#JDBC Configutation for Database Connection
jdbc.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://db01:3306/accounts?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull
jdbc.username=admin
jdbc.password=admin123

#Memcached Configuration For Active and StandBy Host
#For Active Host
memcached.active.host=mc01
memcached.active.port=11211
#For StandBy Host
memcached.standBy.host=127.0.0.2
memcached.standBy.port=11211

#RabbitMq Configuration
rabbitmq.address=rmq01
rabbitmq.port=5672
rabbitmq.username=test
rabbitmq.password=test

#Elasticesearch Configuration
elasticsearch.host =192.168.1.85
elasticsearch.port =9300
elasticsearch.cluster=vprofile
elasticsearch.node=vprofilenode
```

Here, all our configuration is correct according to our service such as DB name, user, passwords etc.. if there is any changes we have to make it in here accordingly.

Once this configuration is done we can build the artifact.

## Building the Artifact using Maven build

`mvm install` : command will start downloading the dependencies and build the project artifact. And below you can see the packaging has been successful.

After build success we can see that **vprofile-v2.war** file has been created in the target folder.

This .war file is the packaged version or working software which we're going to deploy in Tomcat Server.

## Deploying the Artifact to Tomcat

Before deploying our application package/artifact, bydefault there is a tomcat application present in the file location(`/usr/local/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT` ) where our application would be relying. So we have to remove that.

`rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT` : this command will remove the existing tomcat webapp.

`cp target/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT.war` : now this command will copy the **vprofile-v2.war** from **target** directory to `/usr/local/tomcat8/webapps` directory and will be renamed from **vprofile-v2.war** to **ROOT.war** .

Now, the **.war** file has been copied to the desired location:

Now, restart the tomcat service by `systemctl start tomcat`

Once you restart the Tomcat service, it will extract the ROOT.war and make it the default application.

And from now, our **Vprofile** application has been set as default application for Tomcat.

Here, the application **packaging** and **deployment** has been completed to the Tomcat service.

# Nginx Setup(ReverseProxy/Web SVC)

We are at the final step of our project deployment. Here we will be setting up Nginx as our reverse proxy to generate the HTTP request.

`vagrant ssh web01` will allow us to ssh into the Tomcat VM where it will be installed.

`sudo -i` get the root privilege

`apt update -y` to update the server as this is a Ubuntu server.

`apt upgrade` to upgrade the system to latest patches

## Installing Nginx

`apt install nginx -y` : this will simply install nginx in ubuntu system

## Creating a configuration file

Here we'll be creating a configuration file which will be used to redirect the traffic from **Nginx** to **Tomcat** **server** on port 8080. This configuration file will be placed at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and the name of the file will be `vproapp` . So, the complete path will be `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vproapp` . And the config file will be having the below configuration:

```bash
upstream vproapp {
server app01:8080;
}
server {
listen 80;
location / {
proxy_pass http://vproapp;
}
}
```

## Removing the default Nginx web page

`rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` : this will remove the default Nginx webpage from the location `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` .

## Activating the Application

Finally, we can activate the application and make it availe to use. To do so, we have to create a link between `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vproapp` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vproapp` with the command :

```bash
 ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/vproapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vproapp
```

And finally restart Nginx with

`systemctl restart nginx` : after all the setup restart the Nginx service and make sure it's up and running .

# Accessing App from Browser

Now to access the Web Site from browser we need the IP address of the server**(web01)** where it is hosted. If it was an EC2 instance we could simply access it from it's public IP by editing the inbound rule and exposing the IP.  
However, as we have set everything in our local system we'll be needing the IP address of the hosted VM.

`ifconfig` : this command will give us the IP address of the VM and the highlighted IP address the one we need.

We are also able to login to the application and this login credentials are coming from MySQL:
