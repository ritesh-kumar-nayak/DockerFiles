Previously on [Jenkins Basics post](https://riteshthedevops.hashnode.dev/comprehensive-cicd-with-jenkins-basic) we have been through the compressive illustration using the Freestyle project. However, we have several other ways of creating and configuring a job. **The Pipeline** is one of them. Going forward we will see a complete pipeline setup with the configuration type **Pipeline.**

# Pipeline vs Freestyle

In Jenkins, a Freestyle project and a Pipeline are two different ways of creating and configuring a job.

**A Freestyle** project is a traditional type of job configuration in Jenkins, where you can configure various build steps, triggers, and post-build actions using a graphical user interface (GUI). It is a more flexible and customizable way of setting up your build process, allowing you to define each step in detail and providing more control over the job.

On the other hand, **a Pipeline** allows you to define your build process using code written in a **Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL).** Pipelines are more structured and organized and provide better visibility into the entire build process. Pipelines also enable you to **version control** your build process, which makes it easier to manage changes and collaborate with other developers.

Overall, while a Freestyle project offers more flexibility and customization options, a Pipeline provides a more structured and scalable way of defining and managing your build process.

# Types of Pipeline

There are **2** types of Pipelines available which are:

## Declarative Pipeline

A Declarative Pipeline is a more opinionated syntax that provides a simpler way of defining your build process using a structured format. The syntax is based on a predefined set of directives and steps, which allows you to focus more on the high-level goals of your build process rather than the underlying implementation details. Declarative pipelines are best suited for simple to medium complexity builds, and provide better readability and maintainability.

## Scripted Pipeline

A Scripted Pipeline is a more flexible way of defining your build process using a Groovy-based script. It provides more low-level control over your build process, allowing you to define your build steps in a more granular way. Scripted pipelines are best suited for complex builds, where you need more control and flexibility over the build process.

Both types of pipelines provide the ability to define a complete build process, including checkout, build, test, and deployment steps. They also allow you to define custom functions and share them across multiple builds. In general, Declarative pipelines are easier to read and maintain, while Scripted pipelines offer more flexibility and control.

# Declarative Pipeline Illustration with Example

## 1.Using the 'Pipeline Script' option

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679744347766/fc62ae8e-fb1f-4493-a788-fdc4b8cee9f4.png align="center")

Declarative Pipeline is a newer way of defining pipelines in comparison to scripted. Jenkins's declarative way of configuration provides a more structured and simplified syntax for defining the pipeline. It aims to provide a more "declarative" way of defining pipelines, where the focus is on what you want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it.

Below is a code snippet that will create an initial pipeline that further brings the code available on the git repository and will just echo the messages in all stages:

```apache
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Code') {
            steps {
                
                git url: 'https://github.com/rkn1999/react_django_todo_app.git' , branch: 'main'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build . -t ritesh1999/django-todo-cicd:latest'
            }
        }
        stage('Docker Push') {
            steps {
                
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerHub', usernameVariable: 'dockerHubUser', passwordVariable: 'dockerHubPassword')]){
                sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPassword}"
                sh 'docker push ritesh1999/django-todo-cicd:latest'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                echo 'Testing the build'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy'){
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation

* **Code**: This stage pulls the codebase from the specified Git repository(https://github.com/rkn1999/react\_django\_todo\_app.git( and branch(main).
    
* **Build**: This stage builds the codebase, but in this script, it simply prints a message to the console indicating that the code is being built.
    
* The `withCredentials` step is now wrapped in a `steps` block and contains a body that includes the `sh` steps that use the retrieved credentials.
    
    Here's what this pipeline does:
    
    1. The pipeline checks out the code from the specified git repository in the `Code` stage.
        
    2. The pipeline builds a Docker image in the `Build` stage.
        
    3. The pipeline logs in to Docker Hub using the specified credentials in the `Docker Push` stage.
        
    4. The pipeline pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub in the `Docker Push` stage.
        
* **Test**: This stage tests the built codebase, but in this script, it simply prints a message to the console indicating that the code is being tested.
    
* **Deploy**: `stage('Deploy')` block is defining a deployment stage in the pipeline, which likely follows a build stage that produces a Docker image.
    
    The `steps` block contains a single `sh` step, which is executing a shell command to bring down any existing containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and then bring up new containers in detached mode (`-d`) using the same file.
    
    Overall, this code block is likely used to deploy a Dockerized application using Docker Compose.
    
    **NB: Whenever you are writing any shell script in Pipeline Script make sure the shell script begins with 'sh' just like :** `sh 'docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d'` **because it will make Jenkins aware that it's a shell script, not a regular Groovy script.**

The "agent any" line at the top of the script specifies that the pipeline can be run on any available Jenkins agent.

Once the script is ready and you build it, the pipeline will look something like the below:

We can also see the logs right here by clicking on each stage whereas previously on freestyle we had to see the console:

On the above log you can see that login to the docker hub is successful using the credentials we defined in **Jenkins Credentials(Described in detail in the below section 'Jenkins Credentials')** and the docker image has been pushed to the docker Hub being authenticated by my docker hub username and password.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679741789359/71e94d7e-e723-4a04-af74-1f6f755c4513.png align="center")

When `docker-compose up` got executed, it again fetched the docker image from the docker hub and made the container up and running.

## 2.Using the 'Pipeline script from SCM' option

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679744473977/d7b8c827-6d5f-4300-bcdb-6fc778b264ad.png align="center")

The pipeline script from SCM(Source Code Management) option does nothing but fetches the same Jenkins script from the Git repository.

The same Jenkins Groovy script will be pushed to the Git repo and then will be reused again and again to build the pipeline which is industry best practice.

### SCM Configuration for Jenkinsfile

Below is the SCM configuration where we have given our git repo URL([https://github.com/rkn1999/react\_django\_todo\_app.git](https://github.com/rkn1999/react_django_todo_app.git)) and branch name \***/main** and Script path as **Jenkinsfile** which is the name of the Jenkins file itself.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679744910992/cb7db4ef-9ef7-465b-bf74-5d36e62f7bc0.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679744938487/025d51df-eef1-445f-966d-eacb439b2980.png align="center")

Once we save the above configuration, Jenkins will point to the git repo to build the pipeline which will look something like the one below where you can see the "Declarative**: Checkout SCM"** column which means the pipeline is built from the SCM. And this is the ideal way which is used in **Production.**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679810496994/a8fbd1ee-fb69-4d2f-8745-c99979d9e923.png align="center")

# App Deployed by Declarative Pipeline

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679743171378/49f9a8e6-4f36-4cd1-afab-d441f54e9684.png align="center")

After the pipeline has run successfully after the deployment step the app is now up and running on port number **8001** as defined in the docker-compose.yaml

# Scripted Pipeline with Code

Scripted Pipeline is an older way of defining pipelines in Jenkins that provides more flexibility and control over the pipeline definition. It allows you to define the pipeline as a series of Groovy scripts, where you have full access to the Jenkins API and can define custom functions and logic.

**NB: We are not using Scripted Pipeline much, so we won't go indept here. Our focus is on Declarative Pipeline.**

Here's an example of a simple Scripted Pipeline:

```bash
node {
    stage('Build') {
        git url: 'https://github.com/rkn1999/java_todo_app.git' , branch: 'main'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        sh 'mvn deploy'
    }
}
```

In the Build stage, the script uses the Git plugin to clone the source code repository of a Java todo application from the 'main' branch.

In the Test stage, the script runs the 'mvn test' command, which suggests that the project is a Maven project and this stage is used for running tests.

In the Deploy stage, the script runs the 'mvn deploy' command, which suggests that the project is also using Maven for deployment. However, the specific deployment steps would depend on the configuration and requirements of the project.

Overall, this pipeline script automates the build, testing, and deployment process for the given application, enabling faster and more consistent software delivery.

# Jenkins Credentials

Jenkins credentials are used to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, access tokens, SSH keys, and other secrets, that are required by Jenkins jobs or pipeline scripts.

Credentials can be used in various ways, such as:

1. Authenticating with external systems or services, such as Git repositories, Docker registries, or cloud providers.
    
2. Connecting to remote hosts via SSH or other protocols.
    
3. Providing authentication credentials for a Jenkins job or pipeline script to run as a specific user or service account.
    
4. Accessing secure configuration files, such as Maven or Gradle settings.xml files, that contain sensitive information.
    

Jenkins provides a wide range of credential types, including username and password, SSH username with the private key, secret text, and others. Credentials can be managed in Jenkins by going to the "Credentials" section in the Jenkins dashboard, where you can create, edit, delete, and organize them.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679737378613/e7644be9-a010-4319-a59c-4c3a1a9410f5.png align="center")

Here, we have added my Docker Hub credentials which will further be used in pushing the **docker image** to the docker hub. These credentials can also be used for logging in to Git and other external platforms if needed as discussed above.

# Agent

## What & Why 'Agents' in Jenkins?

In Jenkins, an agent is a machine or environment that can be used to execute builds or jobs. It can be a physical or virtual machine, a container, or even a cloud-based environment. Agents are essential in Jenkins because they allow for distributed builds, enabling a single Jenkins master to delegate work to multiple agents. This can greatly increase the speed of build execution and enable the parallelization of tasks.

Master will control the jobs by allocating the Jobs to different agents.

In order to establish the connection between Jenkins master and agents, agent servers need to have Java installed(as Jenkins is based on Java) and Jenkins user created in them.

## Use case of Agents in Jenkins

1. Suppose you have a build job that takes a long time to execute, and you want to run it faster by running the work across multiple agents simultaneously. You can configure the job to use multiple agents, and Jenkins will **distribute** the work across them. For example, you can split the build job into three stages, and configure each stage to run on a different agent. This can greatly reduce the overall execution time of the job.
    
2. Suppose you have a Jenkins setup with a master node and three agent nodes - one on a physical machine, one on a virtual machine, and one on a cloud environment. You have a build job that requires a specific environment to run, say a Windows machine with a certain set of tools installed. You can configure the build job to run on an agent that meets these requirements.
    

To summarize, agents in Jenkins are machines or environments that can be used to execute builds or jobs. They are essential in enabling distributed builds and parallelization of tasks, which can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of build execution.

## Advantages of implementing Jenkins Agents

1. Distributed Builds: Agents enable Jenkins to distribute build tasks across multiple machines or environments. This allows builds to be executed in parallel, greatly reducing the overall build time.
    
2. Scalability: With agents, Jenkins can easily scale up or down to meet the demands of different build tasks. For example, if a build requires a specific environment or toolset, an agent can be configured with those requirements and used only when needed.
    
3. Flexibility: Agents provide flexibility in terms of where and how builds can be executed. They can be physical or virtual machines, containers, or cloud-based environments. This allows Jenkins to execute builds in a variety of scenarios and environments.
    
4. Load Balancing: Jenkins can use agents to balance the load of build tasks across multiple machines or environments. This can help prevent overload and ensure that builds are executed efficiently.
    
5. Security: By using agents, Jenkins can ensure that builds are executed in isolated environments, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring that each build runs in a clean environment.
    

# Setting up Agents in Jenkins

### Step-1(Lunching Multiple EC2 Instances)

To set up Jenkins Agents, you need multiple EC2 instances to be connected to each other through SSH connection. So the first step will be to lunch multiple EC2 instances apart from Jenkins Master with the required amount of storage.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679834931168/b6808feb-06e3-4f35-a5bf-113288ae0935.png align="center")

### Step-2(SSH Key Generation)

To establish the connection between the master and agent through SSH, **2** keys such as the **Private Key** and the **Public** Key will be required. **The Public Key** will be given to the agent instance and the **Private key** will be used by **Master Instance.**

* To generate the keys in the **Master** use `ssh-keygen` command which will generate the key pair as below:
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679835333132/987164d3-e5be-4a76-92dc-b5ed47517849.png align="center")
    
    In the above image, you can see that the key has been generated and saved in `/home/ubuntu/.ssh` .
    
    By getting into the .ssh you can see the keys named as **id\_rsa** and **id\_rsa.pub**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679835589804/1886e892-c419-49f3-89b1-4625f99eb488.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679836173148/cf30be2e-bd85-48cd-9554-4785d7b8d592.png align="center")
    
    The above one is the **public key** that we can see using `cat id_rsa.pub` .
    

Here **id\_rsa** is the private key and **id\_rsa.pub** is the public key. Now, this public key has to be given to the Agent server.

To do so, move to the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh` in the **Agent** server and there you will be seeing a file called **authorized\_keys** as below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679835923390/05841159-6dba-4c23-80fd-c06314aae155.png align="center")

And we have to edit that file with `vim authorized_keys` and paste the **public key** from the master node(**id\_rsa.pub)** and save as below so that it can use this key while connecting to Master:

### Step-3(Connecting using SSH)

**NB:** The **Agent** can only connect to the **Master** and it can't be vice-versa.

So, to connect the **Agent** to the **Master** we will be using the command `sudo ssh ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-88`

which simply means we are trying to establish a connection to the server `ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-88`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679837020217/7acc385e-6df4-4c35-83a2-41096ed9022c.png align="center")

And it's normal to get the **permission denied** error for the first time.

Until now we were just trying to set up the connection between 2 EC2 instances however, our main goal is to set up an agent in Jenkins. Going forward we will be establishing the same connection from Jenkins.

### Step-4(Creating Agent in Jenkins)

To set up an agent in Jenkins, go to **Manage Jenkins** and click on **Set up agent:**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679837296817/97f549b1-41b4-41d7-a907-e265ef4f0617.png align="center")

Give a name to the and proceed further:

You can give any name and description as per your project.

**The number of Executors:** The number of executors on a Jenkins agent determines the number of jobs that can be run concurrently on that agent.

**Remote Root Directory:** In Jenkins, a remote root directory refers to the directory on the agent machine where Jenkins will execute the build. When you set up a Jenkins agent, you can specify a remote root directory on the agent machine where the build will be run. This directory will be used by Jenkins to store temporary files, logs, and other build artifacts during the build process.

**Labels:** They are used to organize and categorize agents based on their capabilities or attributes. For example, if you have a group of agents that have a specific set of tools or software installed, you can assign a label to that group to easily identify and select them for a particular job.

**Usage:**

* **Use this node as much as possible:** This is the default setting.  
    In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.
    
* **Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node:** In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when that project is restricted to certain nodes using a label expression, and that expression matches this node's name and/or labels.

**Lunch method:** this defines the way we want to connect the agent. For now, it's **via SSH**

**Credentials:** to lunch through SSH we need SSH keys so we have to add the Credentials as described below in the **"Adding Credentials for SSH"** section. Once you add the credentials to Jenkins it will be shown as an option to choose:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679839782314/f51e1b36-f0bc-4985-b0fa-c2f5d77a5f3e.png align="center")

And we have choosen the highland one as our SSH key.

**Availability:** it defines when should the agent needs to be active and when to be offline. Here we have chosen to keep this online as much as possible.

### **Adding Credentials for SSH:**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679838814570/6e506ea3-2942-4da8-9a9a-3e053dd5110d.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679838837381/fc673427-c732-4aa8-a95e-e63a18838311.png align="center")

**Kind:** Here we have chosen kind as **SSH Username with a private key** because we will be using connecting the Agent to the Master with SSH.

**Private Key:** In the private key section we have to give the private key of **the Master** server because this Jenkins is hosted in the **Master** itself. We can't expose other servers' private keys in another server.

And then click on **Add** to the Credentials will be added.

### Step-5(Agent Created & Installing Java in Agent)

After following all the above steps correctly you can see the agent has been created as below where we have **Jenkins-Agent-1** created and listed with Built-in Node:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679840401042/e29171f7-9edc-4a25-ae98-bbeb90eff323.png align="center")

However currently, you can see the Jenkins-Agent-1 is not yet connected because to connect through Jenkins we need **Java** to be installed which is not yet done in the **Agent** server. In the logs also we can see :

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679840598908/32e76b84-d768-48a6-9ad0-da39cf97b5be.png align="center")

So to Proceed further we have to install the **exact version of** Java in the **Agent** server with the command `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre` .

### Step-6(Establishing Connection)

Once Java is installed in the **Agent** server, you can go to the agent and click on Lunch Agent. Then the agent will start connecting and the logs will look like the below which shows that `Agent successfully connected and online` . You can go through the log to see the impact after Java installation:

```bash

### Step-7(Agent Connected)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679841292142/acfe73b3-7ec7-4d17-9073-ed7c2b70ddce.png align="center")

Now, in the above image, you can see that the **Jenkins-Agent-1** which was offline previously is now connected and **In Sync.**

# Deployment through Agent

As you know previously we have created **two** types of Jenkins Jobs:

* Via Freestyle Project
    
* Pipeline
    

Now we'll see how to configure both the types with Jenkins Agent and run the job on Agent.

## Prerequisite for Agent server

* Install docker in the agent so that it can identify docker while containerizing by docker file.
    
* Install docker-compose in the agent so that it can identify docker-compose while running by docker-compose.yaml file.
    
* Add docker as a user by using : `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`
    

## 1-Deployment of Freestyle Project to Jenkins-Agent

While working with the Freestyle project it's easier to configure with an agent.

To do so, select "**Restrict where this project can be run"** and add the **Label Expression** that was created for the agent during Agent creation as shown below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679842689229/40e056f7-eb53-481b-934f-1b698289fa51.png align="center")

Once we save the configuration, in the executor status at the left below corner you can see we have one Built-In Node and **JenkinsAgent-1.** However, under **JenkinsAgent-1** there is **1 Idle** which means on the agent one pipeline is tagged to run on **JenkinsAgent-1.**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679843059107/5fd61ca9-439d-489f-9e44-a25f43983bd4.png align="center")

Now, when we build the project by clicking on the Build Play button or by Git Push it will run the Job on the tagged server as below. Here as our Pipeline is tagged to JenkinsAgent-1 it is now running under the same:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679843799366/f24bf312-38e2-45fb-944c-460a32413c16.png align="center")

Now, on the console output as well you can see that it is Building on JenkinsAgent-1 remotely:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679843894002/4e370f3b-e060-422e-b370-184bc861a764.png align="center")

Also the **Agent Server** you can see that the docker containers are up and running as below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679843991312/cf3e94d2-60b7-46a1-ad47-defa7edc2f75.png align="center")

### The app from Freestyle Project is Deployed in Jenkins-Agent:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679844130684/54066455-8233-4c03-970f-1129c570a770.png align="center")

## 2-Deployment of Declarative Pipeline Project to Jenkins-Agent

Now, running any declarative pipeline in Jenkins Agent is much easier. Here we only have to change the `agent any` to `agent {label 'For-Django-App'}` as below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679845035305/e630d26a-a052-418e-af9d-881af1c9da18.png align="center")

**NB:** Similarly, if you are fetching the Jenkins File from SCM then you can make the changes in JenkinsFile in Git and fetch it from there.

Now below you can see again it's running on JenkinsAgent-1

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679845102848/773c3177-11a1-48a8-a986-8fb664f6f7b2.png align="center")

Now you can see this is the Declarative Pipeline project **Django\_TODO** console where it is running on **JenkinsAgent-1**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679845187447/4ab79f15-72a8-4bf6-8884-ec207a14180c.png align="center")

Below you can see the Container is Up and Running about a minute:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679845242889/7671ae06-0aa3-421b-9452-8c5d42dddaff.png align="center")

### The app from Declarative Pipeline is Deployed in Jenkins-Agent:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679845270477/b428b3b3-bb1c-4806-8817-2cc2652b9177.png align="center")

# Conclusion

Here we have completed Jenkins E2E.

We have covered Freestyle Project vs Declarative Project

Jenkins as Code

We have implemented Jenkins Agents to run the Jobs Remotely on a different Server and **many more.**

Thanks For your Patience!!

Hope it Helps !! :)
